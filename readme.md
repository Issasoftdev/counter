# Counter App

January 2022

I did this project inorder to practice Javascript.

I learnt how to use `querySelectorAll()` to select multiple elements, then
loop over them with the `forEach()`, and using CSS Classes to handle events and make changes to the DOM.

I also used water.css to quickly style my app.
